 DISTRIBUTED REAL-TIME SYSTEM
------------------------------
This project describes the simplified architecture of 
the electronics and software of a solar vehicle. Several 
Electronic Control Units are connected by a CAN bus.

Each node on the CAN network is composed of a processor, 
a process, and a set of threads. Inter-nodes connections 
generate messages that are multiplexed on the bus. 

The simulation shows how the local scheduling of the sending 
and receiving threads on each node and the scheduling of 
the messages on the bus interact together.

Note that the project references a file located remotely on 
the AADLib github. In case of a lack of internet connection, 
some of the analysis tools may raise an error.
